## Database

This API uses SQLite as the database system for storing alert data. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, and file-based database that is well-suited for small to medium-sized applications. It's chosen for its simplicity and portability.

The `alerts` table in the database has the following schema:

- `id` (INTEGER): An identifier for the alert.
- `message` (TEXT): The content of the alert message.
- `timestamp` (DATETIME): The timestamp when the alert was created.

## Endpoints

### Create or Update Alert

- **Endpoint:** `POST /alerts`
- **Description:** This endpoint allows users to create or update an alert. Users can specify a custom `id` in the request body. If the `id` exists, the alert with that ID will be updated with the new message. If the `id` does not exist, a new alert will be created.
- **Request Body (JSON):**
```json
{
  "id": 1, // Custom alert ID (optional)
  "message": "This is an alert message"
}



## Get Alert by ID

- **Endpoint:** `GET /alerts/{alert_id}`
- **Description:** This endpoint allows users to retrieve a specific alert by its ID.
- **Response (Success - HTTP 200 OK):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "message": "This is an alert message",
  "timestamp": "2023-11-10 12:34:56"
}
```

## Get All Alerts

- **Endpoint:** `GET /alerts`
- **Description:** This endpoint allows users to retrieve all alerts.
- **Response (Success - HTTP 200 OK):**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "message": "Alert 1",
    "timestamp": "2023-11-10 12:34:56"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "message": "Alert 2",
    "timestamp": "2023-11-10 12:35:01"
  }
]
```

## Examples

### Create a New Alert

}
```
The response will be:

```json
{
  "message": "Alert with ID 1 created successfully"
}
```



## Get Alert by ID
